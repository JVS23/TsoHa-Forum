# TsoHa-Forum

A generic web forum which will possibly be later modified to have a theme of some sort.

## Installation guide

Currently working only locally, install with poetry using "poetry install", and running it with the command "poetry run flask run" while inside the "app" directory. Note that you need to have a psql server running. Remember to input your own server (and a secret key!) in a .env file to connect your own database. Do also remember to create the tables from the schema.sql file.

## Current state

The forum is currently in an early stage, with features like account creation and management working. The forum itself is WIP, and will be added soon.

To do:

- Threads (and respective SQL table changes)
- Replying to threads
- Visuals
- Categories(?)
- Code structure cleanup to modules
- Testing
- Security (fix vulnerabilities, add CSRF protection, etc.)
