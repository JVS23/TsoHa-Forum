# TsoHa-Forum

** IMPORTANT: The web application is not live anymore due to the course being over **

A web forum for sharing, rating and discussing ASCII art with others. The forum is created as a project for the course **Aineopintojen harjoitusty√∂: Tietokantasovellus (periodi III, 2022-2023), Helsingin Yliopisto**. The forum is created using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and PostgreSQL. The user interface was created using Bootstrap, and some custom CSS on top of it. The web app was hosted on Fly.io, but because the course has ended it is not up anymore.

## Usage

You can use the forum by creating you own account on the main page, and then you're free to share your own masterpieces and check out what others have made.
You can also give likes to the art that others (and yourself, if you feel that way) have made, and reply below their posts with a comment. The forum also has subpages for filtering categories that can be accessed from the navigation bar.

The forum can also be used by installing it locally. You only need to clone the main branch if doing so, since there is a fly.io deployment branch too with different configs which don't work locally. You can find the local installation guide [here](documentation/installation.md).
