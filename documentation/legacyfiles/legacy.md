## Short description

My project will be a web forum hosted on fly.io (probably, if no better alternative comes up) created using Python and Flask. Database operations will be handled using PostgreSQL.
The forum will have the option to create new users and log onto them, with different usage access for admin and normal users. 
The forum itself will have all of the expected features, for example creating, editing and removing of posts, categorizing them and searching for posts.
If there's enough time, I will probably look into integrating some more experimental features like small-size file hosting and sharing possibilities (.txt files and such as an learning experiment). I'd also like to put some effort into the visual side, probably with using Bootstrap + CSS.
